In reverse chronological order:
- 2023-?: Cofounder / Research Lead at [EvolutionaryScale](https://www.evolutionaryscale.ai/), working on models for protein design and scientific intelligence. I do a little bit of everything, from eng to research. We did ESM3 ([published in Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads0018)) and [ESMC](https://www.evolutionaryscale.ai/blog/esm-cambrian). Check out our open source models on [github](https://github.com/evolutionaryscale/esm).
- 2020-2024: Graduated from NYU under Yann LeCun - my PhD was creating ESMFold, ESM2. [paper published in Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade2574); [github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm); ESMAtlas](https://esmatlas.com/); [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/facebook/esmfold_v1); top-10 in HF model downloads at one point!
- 2016-2020: Prior life at Meta's FAIR as an Research Engineer - helped create [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), designed the [PyTorch C++ API](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_frontend.html). Did an [RL framework](https://torchcraft.github.io/TorchCraftAI/) to try to train some large scale RL models for StarCraft BW. Designed and developed a distributed RL library in PyTorch C++ to do this. In 2019 AlphaStar came out and I started working on [ESM-1b](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2016239118) before starting my PhD.
- 2012-2015: Speedran UVa (CS/Math); undergrad and masters in 3.5 years ðŸ˜‡ . Here's my [thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03004), where I started working on AI in biology.

Secret sauce:
- [Kakoune](https://kakoune.org/) is a work of art.
- I get asked about my dotfiles a lot. [Here](https://github.com/ebetica/dotfiles) they are.
- Yes you should use [ESM2-3B](https://huggingface.co/facebook/esm2_t36_3B_UR50D), stop using ESM2-150M please.

Major accomplishments:
- Breaking the FAIR cluster at least 3 times by scaling too hard...
- Current highest climbing grades: 12a sport (Tricks for you, Tensleep); 10d trad (The Winter, gunks)
- Running away to the circus when work is hard
- 5000+ MMR on Dota 2 in 2019, unfortunately never made it to Immortal league
- Being tased by a breadboard taser while playing SCBW in the TJHSST computer room before math team

Proudest climbs:
- East face of Whitney + Fishhook Arete on Russell
- West Face of Leaning Tower (8 pitches, 5.8 C2)
- Inti Watana => Resolution Arete (19 pitches, 10c)
- Timewave Zero (23 pitches, 12a, aided the crux)
